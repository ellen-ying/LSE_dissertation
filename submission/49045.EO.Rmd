Gender gap in labour force participation is a world-wide phenomenon which is particularly pronounced in developing countries. Globally, the rate of labour force participation is about 75% among men while only 50% among women **(International Labour Organization, 2021)**. In regions such as Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia, the gender gap is even greater, with around 75% of men and 20% of women participating in the labour force **(International Labour Organization, 2021)**. In the search of potential measures to narrow the gender gap, its causes have been extensively studied with a recent attention on the prominent role of social norms. Researchers speculate that interventions aiming at changing social norms may be the key to achieve greater gender equality in labour force participation **(Bursztyn et al., 2020; Codazzi et al., 2018; Jayachandran, 2021)**.

A recent successful attempt in developing such social norm interventions was made by Bursztyn and colleagues **(2020)** in Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, gender norms exist that expect women to be absent from labour or segregated from men at workplace, and that women need approval from their male "guardian" (usually the husband or father) if they want to work outside the home **(Bursztyn et al., 2018)**. These allow us to make a reasonable speculation that the low female labour participation rate **(28% in 2022, International Labour Organization)** may be because men don't allow their wives to work outside the home (WWOH) due to the internalisation of the gender norms (i.e., personal beliefs aligning with the norm that women should not work outside the home). Interestingly, however, Bursztyn and colleagues **(2020)** found that the critical factor was rather Saudi men's misperception of the injunctive norms regarding WWOH. Their findings revealed that 80-85% of surveyed Saudi men who were married and aged 18-35 reported to agree with the statement that women should be allowed to work outside the home, while more than three quarters of them underestimated this percentage. 

Based on this result, Bursztyn and colleagues **(2020)** designed an intervention to correct men's misperception regarding WWOH found evidence supporting evidence for its effectiveness in changing their labour supply decisions. They found that men who received correct information of the true percentage of supporting men (vs. those who did not receive the information) were significantly more likely to sign up for job matching service for their wives immediately after the intervention. Their wives were also more likely to have applied and interviewed for a job three to five months after the intervention. The researchers also tested the effect of a similar intervention on Saudi women in a field setting, finding that women who received the information on the percentage of men supporting WWOH (vs. those who did not received the information) were more likely to take up a part-time job outside the home, the alternative of which is a job that can be done at home.

The present study is inspired by this promising intervention method of correcting the misperception of social norm.
